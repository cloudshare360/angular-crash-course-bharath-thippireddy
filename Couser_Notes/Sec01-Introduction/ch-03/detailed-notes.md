| **Introduction â€” What is AngularJS?**<br><br>AngularJS is a framework for building single-page applications (SPAs). It uses HTML templates and TypeScript/JavaScript to create reusable components and rich client-side behavior. SPAs provide a smooth user experience by avoiding full page reloads and updating the UI dynamically. | ![Intro image](image-6.png) |
| **Angular as an SPA framework (HTML + TypeScript)**<br><br>Angular leverages TypeScript and declarative templates to make code more maintainable. The Angular CLI helps scaffold projects and enforces conventions that speed up development and reduce configuration overhead. | ![SPA image](image.png) |
| **Components & Project Structure**<br><br>A component packages the template (HTML), logic (TypeScript), and styles. Every application has a root component and many child components. Components communicate via @Input and @Output bindings and help organize the app into cohesive pieces. | ![Components image](image-1.png) |
| **Templates: Directives & Data Binding**<br><br>Templates control how data is displayed. Directives (structural and attribute) manipulate the DOM; data binding (property and event) connects the template to component data and user actions. These features enable responsive, interactive UIs without imperative DOM code. | ![Templates image](image-2.png) |
| **Services & Dependency Injection**<br><br>Services contain business logic and data access (HTTP). Dependency injection makes services available to components and ensures a testable, modular architecture. Use the HttpClient service for RESTful communication and observables for reactive flows. | ![Services image](image-3.png) |
| **Routing & Navigation**<br><br>The router maps URLs to components and supports route parameters, guards, and lazy loading. Routing lets SPAs behave like multi-page apps while maintaining a fast, client-side navigation experience. | ![Routing image](image-4.png) |
| **Angular Versions â€” 2+ vs AngularJS (1.x)**<br><br>Angular 2 was a major rewrite of AngularJS (1.x). Later releases (4,5,6...) are incremental improvements on the Angular (2+) platform. Focus on the modern Angular stack for new projects. | ![Versions image](image-5.png) |
