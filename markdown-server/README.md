# Markdown Server

Simple Node/Express server to browse and render Markdown files under the `Couser_Notes` directory.

How to run:

1. From the repository root, install dependencies for the server:

```bash
cd markdown-server
npm install
```

2. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open http://localhost:4000/ in your browser and click any markdown file to view it rendered as HTML.

Security: This is a simple local utility. Don't expose it to the internet without adding proper access controls.
